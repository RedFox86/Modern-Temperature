This is a mod that adds a temperature system to Minecraft, inspired by Tough as Nails. As you journey throughout your minecraft world, your temperature will go up and down, and getting too cold or too hot will have consequences. Fortunately, there are ways to protect yourself from the elements! Standing near a campfire, torch, lava, etc will keep you warm whereas standing in water, on ice, or near a soul campfire / torch etc will keep you cool. Some biomes are naturally warm (eg. jungles), some are naturally cool (eg. snowy plains), some are burning hot (the nether), and some are freezing cold (the end). Only by preparing yourself extremely well will you be able to brave the cold and heat.

Config:
(Almost) everything inside this mod is customizable! Config is stored at .minecraft/config/monderntemperature-common.toml and contains various values such as which blocks will keep you cool or warm when you stand near them, the default temperature of various biomes, and how much insulation armor gives you.

FAQ:
- Q: How do I know my temperature value in game?
- A: You can see a little orb above your hotbar that will change colors depending on your temperature. If it's shaking, you're likely to start taking damage. Additionally, you can run /temperature get to see your exact value.

- Q: Fabric port?
- A: No! Although, out of all my mods, this one is the one I'm most likely to port.

- Q: I have a question / issue / bug report!
- A: Come report it on the issue tracker [here](https://github.com/RedFox86/Modern-Temperature/issues)!
